# Overbård

<pre >
'Bård' is a Norwegian man's name pronounced 'board'. The alternative spelling is 'Baard'
</pre>

Overbård is a lightning fast Kanban board integrating with Jira. It is shipped as a Jira add-on. 

It was written to address some of Jira Agile's short-comings when it comes to how it displays the boards. 
Effectively this means:
<ul class="standard-list">
<li class="standard-list">horizontally scrollable boards, with collapsible colums.</li>
<li class="standard-list">making setup of filters and swimlanes less static, minimising the need for configuration. Since we 
are using a 'fat' browser client, all changes to the view purely happen on the client side with no need 
for extra round trips to the server.
</li>
</ul>

Apart from the configuration, all the data and permissions are driven by your Jira instance.
